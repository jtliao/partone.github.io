      <span style="color:#876f22"><b>COLOUR</b> </span>
      <span style="color:#495c32"><b>THEORY</b> </span>
      is a concept that was contrived in the 18th century by various European thinkers as a means of <b>controlling</b> the way we see the world around us.<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/index.html">1</a></sup>
      <br><br>
      Colour theory is an <b>intentionally</b> convoluted and enigmatic system that fabricates relationships between colours through systemic classification and hierarchy.
      <br><br>
      The majority have learned to accept colour theory as a universal truth thanks to our flawed education system.  Classroom activities are devised to lead children to the conclusion that colour theory is a correct and applicable way of understanding and mixing colours.
      <br><br>

              <span style="color:#485bf0"><b>blue</b></span>
              are the primary colours, yet computers use

            <div class="lieExplanation">
              The mainstream response to this question is that <span style="color:#b81a1a"><b>red</b></span>,
              <span style="color:#37912c"><b>green</b></span>, and
              <span style="color:#485bf0"><b>blue</b></span>
              are, like the traditional primary colours, a colour palette from which all other visible colours can be derived.  This common rhetoric used by scientists, computer engineers, and other colour theorists is <b>fallacious</b>.
              <br><br>
              Colour theory admits that <span style="color:#d6b018"><b>yellow</b></span> and <span style="color:#485bf0"><b>blue</b></span> produce <span style="color:#37912c"><b>green</b></span> while simultaneously demostrating that when using
              <span style="color:#b81a1a"><b>R</b></span>
              <span style="color:#37912c"><b>G</b></span>
              <span style="color:#485bf0"><b>B</b></span>
              , <span style="color:#b81a1a"><b>red</b></span> and <span style="color:#37912c"><b>green</b></span> produce yellow.
              <br><br>
              How could combining a primary and secondary colour produce a primary colour?  Why is this concept not shown on the colour wheel?

            <div class="lieTitle">The existence of <b>black</b></div>
            <div class="lieExplanation">
              Most people wouldn't flinch when saying that <b>black</b> is a colour, but this hasn't been true for most of human history.
              <br><br>
              Darkness is the absence of light - yet how can a colour such as <b>black</b> exist under natural or artificial when it is the darkest colour of all?  It is strange to consider that our eyes need light to see colours, yet we see black in complete darkness.
              <br><br>
              It wasn't until the late Middle Ages that the concept of <b>black</b> being a colour began to exist.  It was later adopted into subtractive colour theory as the final output of mixing all colour together.
              <br><br>
              We must ask ourselves whether <b>black</b> is truly a colour, or a concept that exists outside of colour that has been misconstrued in order to legitmise traditional colour theory.

            <div class="lieExplanation">
              <div class="lieExplanation">
                Light and dark, <i>white</i> and <b>black</b>.  If these word pairs seem naturally linked, it's likely you have been exposed to colour theory.  If we read into these words a little more we may begin to notice a slight discord in their relationship.
                <br><br>
                Think of the darkest, most opaque thing you can, maybe you're think of a deep ditch or a night with no moon, things that could accurately be represented with the colour palette that colour theory affords us.
                <br><br>
                Now think of the lightest, brightest thing you can.  You probably thought of the sun.  The sun was our first light source and continues to be our fount of daily illumination yet how is it represented using traditional colour theory?  Vey poorly.
                <br><br>
                I have never been blinded by the sun in Van Gogh's <a style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" href="images/WheatfieldWithAReaper.jpg">Wheatfield with a Reaper</a> or seen a shadow cast by <a style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" href="images/StarryNight.jpg">Starry Night</a>.  Most people use light/dark terminology while still believing that colour is limited in its ability to true light. This is one of the many deceptions that colour theory has taught a large part of the population not to question.

            <div class="lieExplanation">Colour theorists often portray water as <span style="color:#485bf0"><b>blue</b></span>, <span style="color:#37912c"><b>green</b></span>, or on occasions <i>white</i>.  Yet you, reader, know that water is none of those colours.  The colour of water is transparent, possibly even reflective.
            <br><br>
            "But those aren't colours!" you may be thinking.  Ask yourself why you believe that transparent and reflective aren't colours and your answer will be that colour theory proclaims them so.
            <br><br>
            The realm of colour beyond colour theory, an important constituent of colour fact, recognises the existence of colours unrestrained by the yoke of the colour wheel.

            <div class="lieTitle">Colours can be defined through frequencies</div>
            <div class="lieExplanation">There exists the belief within colour theory that all colours occupy a place within the spectrum of visible light and that each one emits a certain wavelength in respect to its frequency which we perceive as a certain colour.  However, let's delve deeper into the term "frequecy".
            <br><br>
            Red colours occupy the highest frequency of the <a style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" href="images/VisibleSpectrum.jpg">visible light spectrum</a> with a whopping frequency of 700nm.  With such a tremendous frequency, you would expect red to be everywhere but in reality, red is not found in the natural world with great frequency.  Roses, apples, red M&Ms, and blood are among the few naturally occuring red <i>things</i>.  <span style="color:#485bf0"><b>Blue</b></span>, on the other hand, should logically have an incredibly high frequency considering that the ocean occupies two-thirds of the Earth's surface (assuming the ocean is blue which is debated in another quesiton).  What about <b>black</b> that doesn't even appear on the visible light spectrum yet is prevalent throughout the entirety of space.

            <div class="lieTitle">Mixing all the colours together produces black...or was it white?</div>
            <div class="lieExplanation">What many people fail to realise about traditional colour theory is that there are two near-opposing schools of thought.  Subtractive colour theory tells us that mixing all colours produces black while additive colour theory tells us that mixing all colours produces white.
            <br><br>
            Much like the Great Schism divided Christianity, colour theory was also divided in its early stages.  In 1850, Hermann Von Helmholtz introduced additive colour theory to the already existing subtractive colour theory.  Whether Helmholtz's creation was an imperfect copy or intentional distinction from traditional colour theory is unknown.
            <br><br>
            However, unlike the branches of Christianity, additive and subtractive colour theory are both present in mainstream culture and their differences are rarely questioned.  <b>How can seemingly identical colour theories produce opposite results?</b>
