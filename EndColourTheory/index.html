      <span style="color:#495c32"><b>THEORY</b> </span>
      is a concept that was contrived in the 18th century by various European thinkers as a means of <b>controlling</b> the way we see the world around us.

      The <b>Fact Society</b> extends an invitation to you to learn and digest the falsehoods and half-truths of colour theory and to take the first step towards your journey with <span style="color:#662E9B"><b>COLOUR</b> </span> <span style="color:#890620"><b>FACT</b></span>.
